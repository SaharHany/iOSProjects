This Repo contains my applied projects on LinkedIn Courses.
Some tips:
1- To dismiss keyboard : myTextField.resignFirstResponder()
2- To show keyboard    : myTextField.becomeFirstResponder()
3- To dismiss keyboard and don't know which field : there is a method in viewcontroller called:
touchesBegan : override this method and write : view.endEditing(true)
